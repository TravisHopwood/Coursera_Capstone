Picky Eaters in College - Where Can I Eat?

Introduction

While many students may know where they want to attend college at a 
younger age because they always liked the mascot, or family members 
are alumni, others have to evaluate schools for many reason to 
figure out which one would be the best fit.  For many students, this 
is their first time moving away from home, and it is a very stressful
process.  Working with college data, academic and financial statistics
for the school are readily available to help make this choice.  
Unfortunately, picky eating is becoming more common in today's college
students, and this is another factor that adds to the stress level of 
students.  For some students, dorm food may not cut it so it is 
important to knowing what other options may be available around a college
campus.  For some students, having plenty of food options available may 
be as important to them as what majors a school offers. For this project,
I plan to provide analysis of school to see which have the most food 
options near campus.
